# PirateCon3 - Android application to track products throughout its lifecycle in a supply chain. The transparency of the whole supply-chain ensures the authenticity of products.

1. Manufacturer/supply chain initiator scans the barcode of the product and automatically a smart contract is created in the   blockchain.

2. Smart contract ensures that an owner exits at every stage of the lifecycle. 

3. Manufacturer assigns next owner(supplier/dealer) in the supply-chain and contract gets updated with the new owner.

3. Product receiver then becomes the new owner and updates the status which adds a record in the blockchain.
